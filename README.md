# Read this before creating new issue

* Search in the open issues for some of keywords of the bug you want to submit. And if you find same(or similar) bug, just update it with your comment if you have something to add.
* Sometimes screenshots more descriptive then words. If you are not lazy apply some of them. If you don't know how to add screenshots with markdown, you can read it [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images)
